The Alerter is a simple monitoring tool, intended to help detect increases in response time for some process. It does that
by computing a few statistics about the process across a 'window' of a certain number of runs, and alerting (returning true)
if certain thresholds are met.

It takes the following parameters: 
 - inputs: A list of integer times for the process. This list may be very long 
 - window size: how many runs long a window is, as an integer 
 - allowedIncrease: how far over 'average' a window or value is allowed to be, as a percent. This is represented as a decimal value based on one, so a 50% allowable increase would be represented as 1.5

Your Alerter should return true if either of the following conditions are met:
 * Any value is more than the allowed increase above the window average in ALL windows in which it appears.
     For example:
         alert({1, 2, 100, 2, 2}, 3, 1.5) should alert: the value 100 appears in three windows ({1,2,100}, {2,100,2}, and {100,2,2}), and in all cases is more than 50% over the average value (34 1/3, 34 2/3, and 34 2/3, respectively). 
         alert({1, 2, 4, 2, 2}, 3, 2) should not alert: the largest outlier is 4, and that value appears in a window with average value 2.6 (The window {2,4,2}), less than 200% of that average
 * Any window's average is more than the acceptable increase over any previous window's average value
     For example:
         alert({1,2,100,2,2}, 2, 2.5) should alert: Even though no individual value causes an alert, there is a window with average 1.5 (The window {1,2}) and a later window with an average more than 2.5 times larger (the window {2, 100}, average 51)
Otherwise, you should return false.
